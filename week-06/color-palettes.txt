# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: 
For some reason when I think of high performance anything, especially computers, I can see colors screaming at you in a bright, exciting way. I feel like a green tone is best for a custom laptop overall, and I added a few darker tones to contrast it as well. You want something like this to be sleek, cool, and rememberable.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices:
I think for this one I really wanted to go with something in between green and blue, sort of like an aquamarine color. I feel like this is important because in my opinion green is similar to 'earthy' things and food that grows, it is also a popular choice for some popular supermarkets. It's also considered to be 'healthy' if you're 'green' as well. And then for the blue half, water would resemble life. I think a good balance in between both with good shading could give that website some really unique depth. 

* A complementary palette for a banking website.
