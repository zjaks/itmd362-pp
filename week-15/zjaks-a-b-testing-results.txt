For this A/B test, I decided to give more insight to a webpage that I use frequently and could use some improvement: MLB.tv. MLB.tv is a subscription-based service that has been around for a long time. It allows you to watch out of market baseball games from anywhere you are and in amazing HD quality that I really haven't seen from a live streaming service before. The mobile app, run off of the "MLB.com At Bat" app, is FANTASTIC in my opinion. The quality is even better than it is on the desktop site. If they could improve their webpage to look and act a little more like the app it would be a much better service overall. It's not necessarily difficult to use, it just lacks the eye appeal that the mobile app has. I could get very deep into re-working this entire website if I really wanted to, but my main focus is the home page. In my mocked-up screenshot of the "new" page, I took away the grid-like UI and simply pasted the app UI into a section of the main page. If you could visually see these games unfolding before you click on the game you want to watch, it would make it more enticing to watch. That being said, MLB.tv's UI when you actually WATCH a game is pretty good on desktop, but definitely could be improved as sometimes it is a but clunky and hard to navigate, along with it seeming like you are going to a different page all together.
