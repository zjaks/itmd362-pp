# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: I very much enjoy the appearance of my baseball glove. The leather is made of a high quality, and it is something I have grown to identify as "my glove".

* Behavioral: This object definitely gives me a great pleasure from using it. It is a "Pro Preferred" model Rawlings glove which means that it is the same glove that some professional baseball players use. It has proven to be a very effective and a good quality glove in the time that I have used it. It's flashy in some ways, but it works better than any I have used. Just sliding my hand in the glove makes me instantly feel the emotion and thought of using it. 

* Reflective: As something to reflect on, I can easily tell more than a few stories about this glove. I consider it to be a part of my life symbolizing my love for baseball. I have a great sense of pride when I wear this glove. It is almost like a costume a super hero wears, it turns me into a different person while I am wearing it. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. It is an aesthetically beautiful glove. Although MyIIT has nothing directly to do with sports or baseball, we can attempt to make our page very appealing to the eyes, since students would be using this on a day to day basis.
2. It brings out emotion in you. When I envision someone using our redesigned page, I imagine that they would get a sense of pride when they see their beautiful IIT login page, it would make them proud to go to their school in a small way. 
3. It is SIMPLE, a little bit of flashy, and it WORKS. This is very important because I believe a user experience should allow anyone to flawlessly navigate around a page that is easy to use, is simple enough for the average user, and also isn't boring in any way. Kind of like a "less is more" approach.
