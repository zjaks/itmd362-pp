# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: I very much enjoy the appearance of my baseball glove. The leather is made of a high quality, and it is something I have grown to identify as "my glove".

* Behavioral: This object definitely gives me a great pleasure from using it. It is a "Pro Preferred" model Rawlings glove which means that it is the same glove that some professional baseball players use. It has proven to be a very effective and a good quality glove in the time that I have used it. It's flashy in some ways, but it works better than any I have used. Just sliding my hand in the glove makes me instantly feel the emotion and thought of using it. 

* Reflective: As something to reflect on, I can easily tell more than a few stories about this glove. I consider it to be a part of my life symbolizing my love for baseball. I have a great sense of pride when I wear this glove. It is almost like a costume a super hero wears, it turns me into a different person while I am wearing it. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:
