# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://drpete.co/blog/25-point-website-usability-checklist
2. https://www.evinex.com/the-ultimate-website-usability-design-checklist/

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Accessibility for everyone is a must. Load times, easy to read, etc. to accomodate 
everyone if possible. Allowing people to change the text size adds to that as well.
2. A simple design that just works. Not overloaded with content or crammed on one page. 
3. Put the intensity to the information users want to know.
4. Avoid unnecessary animation and popups.
5. Company/site Logo Is Prominently Placed. 
6. Navigation Labels Are Clear & Concise.
7.  Major Headings Are Clear & Descriptive
8. Don’t make users re-enter information even if they click a browser’s back button.
9. Avoid opening a new window if possible.
10. Pay attention to the contrast of colors between text and background.
